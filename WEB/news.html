                        <p>It’s nearly time for LeBron James to step onto NBA courts for a 22nd season, with it being one of the most special debuts for King James yet as he will do so with his son Bronny. In addition to this excitement, fans are gearing up for the launch of the Nike LeBron 22, which has not yet been officially announced, but is visible here in its debut “Moonlight” colorway. Spotted at the start of the month, it combines “White,” “Volt Glow,” “Medium Ash,” “Hot Lava” and “Wolf Grey” to create an eye-catching look that James is likely to wear sometime this season. Release remains anticipated to take place on November 1 via Nike SNKRS and select retailers at a starting price of $180 USD. Stay tuned for a complete rundown of the new performance sneaker’s specifications and revisit our initial story below for more info.</p>
